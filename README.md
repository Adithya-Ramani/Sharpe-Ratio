# A study of the key terms and concepts in finance and portfolio

## What is a Portfolio
A portfolio is a set of allocation in a variety of securities. Its a collection of a wide variety of financial investments such as stocks, bonds, gold, real estate, cash, CCE, commodities, ETF. They also include collectibles (Artworks, wine, collections, etc)
The percentages in a portfolio should add upto 100% or if its expressed in weights, it should total upto 1
Key Terms
a. Daily returns- The % returned from 1 day to the next in stocks
b. Cummulative returns- The amount returned after an entire period
c. Avg daily returns- The 'Mean' of Daily returns
d. Std daily returns- Standard deviation of daily returns (volatility of the actual return)

Volatility and fluctuations could mean greater risk but then, capitalizing properly on volatility can give great returns compared to market average (This implies greater risk apetite)
According to 'Modern Portfolio Theory' adding assets to a diversified portfolio which has low correlation can decrease portfolio risk without sacrificing returns
This means, increasing diversification should increase the Sharpe Ratio compared to similar portfolios with lower diversification.
The ratio is the average return earned iin excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility

## Sharpe Ratio
It is a ratio developed by William F. Sharpe
This ratio has become the Industry standard
It is used to calculate the risk-adjusted return
Sharpe Ratio = (Expected Portfolio return - Risk-free rate of return / Portfolio standard deviation)
The Risk-free return could be understood as the return when money is invested in banks or government bonds or treasury bills, where the returns are not high but safety of funds is ensured. In markets, this rate is approximately 0 (ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚). To be more precise, inflation rate is more than the bank interest rate, which means that our money in banks is losing value over time

## Annualizing Sharpe ratio
To annualize the Sharpe ratio, we need to multiple the Sharpe ratio by the K-factor.
Annualised Sharpe Ratio (ASR) = K * Sharpe Ratio (SR)
Daily = sqrt(252) (There are only 252 business days)
Weekly = sqrt(52)
Montlhy = sqrt(12)
Yearly = sqrt(1) (This is as good as doing nothing ðŸ˜œ, as SR is basically a yearly figure)
